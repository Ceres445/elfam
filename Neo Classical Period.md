- Literary devices: [[syncope]], alliteration, repetition, [[caesurae]], [[enjambment]].
- Themes: fear of future, God/religion, career (writing).

- Speaker has spent his life in the light (he could see) but now has to spend it in the dark ( he can't see), he is afraid that he won't be able to write anymore.
- Milton talks about his talent of writing and his knowledge of the Bible, and how he wants to serve God through his writing, he asks if God requires labour from those that can't see.
- Patience is personified and answers Milton's questions, God only requires that someone accepts that he is in control of their fate and gives themselves over to him, not their gifts or work.
