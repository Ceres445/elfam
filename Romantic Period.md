# SOLITARY REAPER- WILLIAM WORDSWORTH
## Glossary
- solitary -> alone 
- reaper ->one who harvest crop
-  profound-> intense
- vale-> valley
## Summary
- “The Solitary Reaper” is a poem by the English poet William Wordsworth. 
- The poem was inspired by the poet’s trip to Scotland in 1803 with his sister Dorothy Wordsworth. It was first published in 1807. 
- In the poem, the speaker tries—and fails—to describe the song he heard a young woman singing as she cuts grain in a Scottish field.
- The speaker does not understand the song, and he cannot tell what it was about. Nor can he find the language to describe its beauty. He finds that the traditional poetic metaphors for a beautiful song fail him. 
- The poem thus calls, implicitly, for a new kind of poetry: one that is better able to approximate and describe the pure, unpretentious beauty of the reaper’s song.

## Summary
- The speaker takes a walk through the designated streets of London. This walk brings
the speaker near the River Thames, which seems to have its course dictated for it as it
flows throughout the city. The speaker sees signs of resignation and sadness in the
faces of every person the speaker passes by.
- The speaker hears this pain too, in the cries men as well as those of fearful newborn
babies. In fact, in every voice in the city, in every law or restriction London places on its
population, the speaker can sense people's feelings of being oppressed by city life.
The speaker hears the cry of young chimney-sweeps, whose misery brings shame on
the Church authorities. 
- Thinking of unfortunate British soldiers dying in vain, the speaker
imagines their blood running down the walls of a palace.
- Most of all, the speaker hears the midnight cries of young prostitutes, who swear and
curse at their situation. In turn, this miserable sound brings misery to their tearful newborn children. The speaker also imagines this sound plaguing what the speaker calls
"the Marriage hearse"—a surreal imagined vehicle that carries love and death together.
