### Themes 
 - Throughout _‘The Wife’s Lament,’_ the speaker focuses on themes of sorrow/depression and loneliness/solitude. No matter what the wife is talking about in the fifty-three lines, she’s alone. When she’s mourning her husband’s departure, she does so alone. When at the end she’s in her hole in the ground, she wishes sorrow on her husband by herself. She states quite clearly in the middle of the poem that there’s no one in her home to whom she can go to for comfort. She’s completely alone.
 - Finally she is hopeful that her husband also remembers her and is grieving for her similar to how she is grieving for him
 - Sorrow depression loneliness, soltitude , 


 - The main thhemes found throughout the poem are depression and loneliness, in the beginning of the poem the speaker tells us about her exile and separation from her husband, but doesn't focus on herself, the speaker tells us more about the conspiring kinsmen and that they separated her and her husband, this is very open ended and confusing as we don't know why they were separated or where the husband is, dead or off in another country apart from her. Then she speaks about the kinsmen confining her into a oak tree, again we don't know why they did that and her state is very terrible, making us empathiise with her sadness and loneliness. Then she wonders about her husband and his love, which she is sure she will never receive again.
