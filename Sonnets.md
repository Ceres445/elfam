# Valediction - John Donne
 - Iambic tetrameter
 - Poem begins with a description of the death of a virtuous man,  which will be peaceful. His love is compared to movement of celestial bodies which is invisible to us on earth but is very significant and powerful. Their parting would be an "expansion" rather than a "breach".
 - Love the speaker and his wife have is spiritual. It is more mental than it is physical
 - They might have two separate souls but now they act as “one.” It is due to this fact that when they part, they will not “endure” a “breach, but an expansion
 - he describes himself and his wife as a compass and says that not matter where he roams he will come back to the starting point. the point being his wife.
 - Themes of death, spirituality, and love
 - Poetic devices: onomatopoeia, imagery, conceit (metaphor).
