# Literary devices 
 - **Allegory**: An allegory is a literary device in which characters, events, and symbols represent abstract ideas or concepts. In this case, the seafarer's journey can be seen as an allegory for the human journey through life. The struggles and hardships faced by the sailor mirror the challenges and hardships that people encounter in their own lives.
